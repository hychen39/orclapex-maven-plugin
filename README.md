Oracle APEX Maven plugin
========================

A Maven plugin for Oracle Application Express development

## About

The primary goal of the Oracle APEX Maven plugin is to streamline and facilitate the build process for APEX applications.

Currently available tasks:
* Import an APEX application in a target workspace. <code>import</code>
* Run [Natural Docs](http://www.naturaldocs.org/) to generate technical documentation based on comments in your code. <code>run-natural-docs</code>

The following tasks are currently being worked on:
* Check your database objects and code for naming violations using the [API_NAMING_CONVENTION](https://github.com/nbuytaert1/orcl-naming-convention) package.
* Extract table and column comments in Natural Docs format.
* Compile a target database schema and invalid database objects notification.
* Automatically generate TAPI (Table API) packages.
